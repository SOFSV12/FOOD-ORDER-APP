# FOOD ORDER APP

React Food Order App, I built this app while taking my react guide course as a code along yo understand how react hooks and featues work in a more realistic scenario, this app include the use of the context api. useContext, useEffect, useReducer were used in the creation of this food order app, data was also stored in a backend Firebase so our data is not always cleared on reloading the app, a checkout modal was added, a cart modal was added, the use of portal was implemented in this project.
